> Your forms are **Good**, but they can be **Better** 💯

👉 **[Formsify](https://formsify.vercel.app/)** helps you in creating better forms, which are **Decentralized**, **Trustless** & **Distributed**.

<!-- PROJECT HEADER -->

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## **The Problem 📌**

👉 **Currently** available "Online Survey Services" are **Centralized**, **Trust-Based** & **Dependent**.

> _" Thus, we have challenges of **Integrity**, **Transparency** and **Accessibility**. "_

🔎 Let's have a **discussion** on the problems and drawbacks of **Online Survey Services**

### **1. Integrity 🤝**

#### **Definition 👋**

> The quality of being **honest** and having strong **moral** principles.

#### **Problems 💢**

> **How do you make sure 👇**

-   that the **server** which holds your information wouldn't be **compromised**?
-   that the **platform** which holds your forms, wouldn't go **down**?
-   that the **system** which holds your data, wouldn't **betray** you?

### **2. Transparency 📋**

#### **Definition 👋**

> Operating in such a way that it is easy for others to **see** what **actions** were **performed**.

#### **Problems 💢**

> **How do you confirm 👇**

-   that your **data** was **unaltered**?
-   that your **forms** were **fair** to all respondents?
-   that no-one **filled** forms on **behalf** of others?

### **3. Accessibility ✅**

#### **Definition 👋**

> The **information** that the user needs must be **perceivable** to them.

#### **Problems 💢**

> **How do you ensure 👇**

-   that your **data** will be accessible, even when system goes **down**?
-   that your **forms** can be **independently** interacted with at all the times?
-   that **access** to your information cannot be **revoked**?

## **Project Goals 💯**

👉 Formsify helps in creating **Decentralized**, **Trustless** & **Distributed** forms by giving each form their **own** digital identity in terms of **smart contract** and storing them **on-chain**.

> _" Thus, we address the challenges of **Integrity**, **Transparency** and **Accessibility**. "_

🔎 Let's have a **discussion** on how Formsify **solves** the problems and drawbacks of **Online Survey Services**

### **1. Integrity 🤝**

#### **Solution ✔️**

> **We make sure 👇**

-   that your data is **decentralized** and therefore, it remains uncompromised because there isn't any single point of failure.
-   that your forms are platform **independent** and the interface can be re-built by anyone if we go down.
-   that the system **isn't controlled** by any single entity, therefore betrayal isn't possible until majority of the network gets compromised.

### **2. Transparency 📋**

#### **Definition 👋**

#### **Solution ✔️**

> **We confirm 👇**

-   that data is **immutable** by storing it on Blockchain.
-   that your forms are **unbiased** in all scenarios by ensuring that they cannot be altered.
-   that **no-one** can fill forms on behalf of others, until and unless respondent's wallet is compromised.

### **3. Accessibility ✅**

#### **Solution ✔️**

> **We ensure 👇**

-   that your **data** is **accessible**, even if go down by storing it on-chain.
-   that your **forms** can be **independently** interacted with by representing them as separate smart contracts.
-   that **access** to your information cannot be **revoked** because no single entity can stop you from accessing it.

## **Improvements in Web3 Ecosystem 🌐**

### **1. Accountability ❗️**

> Respondent **cannot deny**, once their **transaction** is recorded on-chain which makes them accountable to their responses.

### **2. Spam Infeasibility ⚠️**

> Since each **form submit** will be backed by some amount of **gas**, it makes the intention of spam entries infeasible in a long run.

### **3. Independency ☑️**

> Forms are **unbiased** and have their **own digital identity** which cannot be tampered with.
